- üè´ Computer Programming Graduate
- üñ•Ô∏è Walking my path towards a field of **CyberSecurity**
- ‚úèÔ∏è Certified in **Security+ by CompTIA, CC by (ISC)2**

I am a passionate computer programming graduate with a strong interest in the world of cybersecurity and digital defense. Not only do I possess a strong understanding of languages such as Python, SQL, and C#, but I have also obtained cybersecurity certificates, including Security+ offered by CompTIA and CC by (ISC)2, to prepare for real-world security incident response. My skills extend to identifying vulnerabilities, mitigating risks, and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical systems and data. Additionally, I have a robust knowledge of operating system administration, networking fundamentals, and network security.

Throughout my studies, I developed powerful problem-solving skills and made valuable contributions to group projects using GIT for version control. Recognized for my academic performance, I achieved President's Honour Roll recognition. One of my standout achievements was the development of a committee management application selected by the client, NC-PAC (Niagara College Program Advice Committee), for use in their real-world meetings and to oversee committee members.

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, continuous learning is paramount. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends, tools, and techniques in the field to better protect organizations from evolving threats. I approach each task with a detail-oriented mindset and a commitment to ensuring the safety of data for both users and stakeholders.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can work closely with developers and other stakeholders, incorporating efficient solutions to overcome challenges and achieve project goals. Currently, I am actively seeking new opportunities in the cybersecurity field. Let's connect and explore how we can work together to achieve mutual success
